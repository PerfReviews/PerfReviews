At the end of October, we had the opportunity to attend the annual event that Google organizes for the *Developer Experts* in Sunnyvale, California. After the event, we met part of the [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) team, whose tools and services we have often used to do performance reviews. It was also the first time the PerfReviews team met in person since we started the project (Joan is based in Barcelona and Jose is in Stockholm).

## Google Developer Experts Summit 2019

![There were more than 500 attendees to the event, including GDEs and Google employees](./thumbs/gde-summit-2019.jpg)

It was our first time attending this event where we learned more about PWA, Chrome Extensions, Google Chrome, and Machine Learning.

But above all, we met many other colleagues in the web world and shared experiences. It gave us the feeling that the Web is still very much alive and that there is a very large community of developers that are essential to advocate for best practices.

## Visiting Cloudinary

Cloudinary is a service that is very helpful for serving images and videos optimally. We talked about their [Media Developer Experts program](https://cloudinary.com/partners/media-developers) and the great work they are doing to generate videos dynamically with different formats, quality, and aspect ratios with auto-cropping (more info [on their blog](https://cloudinary.com/blog)).

It is always interesting to meet the people who work creating these tools and live firsthand the culture that is breathed in their office. Thank you for receiving us!
