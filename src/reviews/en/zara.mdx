### Static Files

- ✅ Uses HTTP/2 and a CDN for serving static files
- ✅ Serves videos in different sizes depending on screen resolution. Just change the path in the URL to 600, 1080, etc.
- ❌ Very short cache times.

### Fonts

- ✅ Uses WOFF2
- ✅ Uses a font with only the necessary characters for Zara SRPLS (ZaraSRPLS_Font-Regular). Could be replaced with an SVG, but it's a good approach.

### Images

- ✅ Implements lazy loading. Good!
- ❌ On the home page, requests SVG images with text in the same font already loaded on the page. CAUTION: Cloudinary suggests converting to WebP to save bytes, but the image may be too small.
- ❌ On mobile, images appear to be requested at a very large size.
- ❌ `products-category.json` references two transparent placeholder images with similar names. Either remove them or unify them.

### Scripts

- ✅ Uses Require.js for loading JS modules instead of a large bundle.
- ❌ Uses jQuery 1.11.2, which has a known vulnerability and was released in December 2014. (see Lighthouse) (see performance audit for mobile version).
- ❌ Lots of unminified inline scripts in the initial HTML.
- ❌ Uses Optimizely on the client-side in a blocking manner. Not minified and contains commented code. WebPageTest [with Optimizely](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190102_GE_d3cd4fb7d5d473923213570633619256/1/details/#waterfall_view_step1) and [without Optimizely](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190102_ND_f8cecf71476e6e6844bf84e9ec1bd8be/7/details/#waterfall_view_step1), and [comparison](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=190102_ND_f8cecf71476e6e6844bf84e9ec1bd8be%2C190102_GE_d3cd4fb7d5d473923213570633619256&thumbSize=200&ival=100&end=visual#)
- ❌ Some resources have very low cache TTL (e.g., `launcher-std.js`, `redesign.css`) (see Lighthouse)

### CSS

- ✅ Good results in CSS Stats.
- ❌ Unminified CSS files, sometimes with commented code (e.g., `spa-hacks` in desktop, `mobile-hacks` in mobile).

### SVG

- ❌ Zara's logo, cart, etc., could be almost halved if optimized through SVGOMG. The idea of SVG + H2 is better than web fonts for icons + HTTP/1.1, which is positive. (see DevTools + SVGOMG)

### Additional Observations

- ✅ Uses Akamai's Boomerang, meaning RUM is set up and page load time is measured. More info at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/products/web-performance/mpulse-real-user-monitoring.jsp) and [Boomerang](https://developer.akamai.com/tools/boomerang/#Introduction)
- ❌ Not very responsive on desktop. The screen can easily cut off. On mobile, a different domain is used.

### Performance Once Loaded

- ❌ Performance issue when scrolling and setting the top position of the left menu.
  In `app-std > adjustVerticalPos > this.$navigationMenu.css`. Also, `onScroll()` lacks throttling. This could be demonstrated by showing Rendering > Paint flashing and a performance recording.
- ❌ The `loader.gif` for images continues to render. Similar to Spotify's issue. It should be hidden.
- ❌ A `raf` is running continuously, probably only used on the main page in desktop and mobile.
